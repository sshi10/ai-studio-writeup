From Coffee Machines to Machine Learning, Accenture

Business Focus
This project centers on applying machine learning methodologies to assist a client in the coffee shop industry in optimizing various facets of their business operations. The primary objectives include:

1. Location Optimization:
Utilizing machine learning algorithms and cleaned datasets to pinpoint the most advantageous location for the client's coffee shop in New York City. Considerations involve variables such as population density, demographic insights, competition analysis, foot traffic patterns, and proximity to key transportation hubs.
2. Specialty Items Selection:
Leveraging customer and business data to discern unique consumer preferences and current trends within the coffee shop market. Identifying three distinct specialty items that align with customer demands, as well as discovering any findings for items to avoid for the appeal of the coffee shop.
3. Business and Marketing Strategies:
Analyzing data and findings in graphs and other mediums to craft tailored marketing strategies for both the business strategy and individual success of the coffee shop. Analyzing customer reviews to determine attributes correlated with successful and underperforming coffee shops, enabling data-driven decisions regarding operational and marketing priorities.
       
This project aims to use the power of machine learning to optimize decision-making for the coffee shop stakeholder, fostering customer satisfaction, refining business strategies, and driving growth and sustainability in the NYC market for a morningâ€™s cup of coffee.
